Explanation of the Code:
Model (User):
The User class represents the data and business logic. It contains the user's name and age properties and a method greet(), which returns a greeting string.
View (UserView):
The UserView class manages the user interface elements such as the input fields (nameInput, ageInput), the button (greetButton), and the area to display output (output).
It provides methods like getUserInput() to fetch the user's input and displayGreeting() to show the greeting on the screen.
Controller (UserController):
The controller takes the UserView (UI) and interacts with the User (data model). It listens for events (like button clicks) and coordinates the interaction between the view and model.
The handleGreetUser() method is triggered when the "Greet" button is clicked. It retrieves the user's input, creates a new User object, gets the greeting from the model, and tells the view to display it.
Flow of the Program:
When the web page is loaded, the UserController sets up event listeners (for example, when the "Greet" button is clicked).
When the button is clicked, the controller collects user data via the view, creates a User object (model), and displays the greeting message using the view.
